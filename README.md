## 📘 Toward Early Detection: A Model for Student Depression Risk
Predicting the likelihood of depression among students using behavioral and academic survey data.

### 🧠 Overview

This project builds a **logistic regression model** to predict whether a student is likely to be experiencing depression, based on features such as sleep duration, financial stress, and academic pressure. We achieved a **ROC AUC score of 0.936**, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

The project was developed as part of a final course project at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in a team of four.
